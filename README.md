The file used in this story includes anonymized responses from 634 respondents who were awarded an SNSF Ambizione grant between 2008 and 2014. Each line represents the responses of a single grantee. Here follows a description of the variables included in the data:

-   `improved.competence.in.research.field`: answer to the question *The Ambizione grant has improved my competence in my research field* (possible responses: `Very accurate`, `Rather accurate`, `Rather inaccurate`, `Completely accurate`, or `No assessment possible`).
-   `enhanced.scientific.profile`: answer to the question *The Ambizione grant has enhanced my scientific profile* (possible responses: `Very accurate`, `Rather accurate`, `Rather inaccurate`, `Completely accurate`, or `No     assessment possible`).
-   `increased.scientific.competitiveness`: answer to the question *The Ambizione grant has increased my scientific competitiveness* (possible responses: `Very accurate`, `Rather accurate`, `Rather inaccurate`, `Completely accurate`, or `No assessment possible`).
-   `increased.number.of.scientific.publications`: answer to the question *The Ambizione grant has increased the number of my scientific publications* (possible responses: `Very accurate`, `Rather accurate`, `Rather     inaccurate`, `Completely accurate`, or `No assessment possible`).
